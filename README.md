# lwip_dpdk
DPDK accelerated lwip userspace protocol stack, built based on lwip-2.1.2, dpdk-stable-17.11.9.

### What's the difference?

We made **no** modification to DPDK and lwip, but only modify the ```netif``` device driver in contrib-2.1.0. So the lwip protocol stack can use DPDK driver to receive and send packets. That will make lwip a "real user space" protocol stack.

We also wrote a socket application in ```/ports/unix/socketdpdk_client&server```. So you can just follow the logical in ```/ports/unix/socketdpdk_server&client/dpdk.c``` to write your own applications.

Currently, we bind the dpdk worker thread to logical core 2. Other threads, like "tcpipthread", are not pinned to any specifical core.


### Usage

To run the application, you first need to compile the DPDK library:

```
cd ${path_to_dpdk}
make install T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc DESTDIR=install
```
Then use command to initialize hugepage memory and bind NIC (we take the vfio-pci driver for example, other informantion can be found in Intel DPDK website; eth3 is the interface that you want to bind to the DPDK driver):
```
mkdir -p /mnt/huge
mount -t hugetlbfs nodev /mnt/huge
echo 1024 > /sys/devices/system/node/node0/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages
modprobe vfio-pci
chmod a+x /dev/vfio
chmod 0666 /dev/vfio/*
ifconfig eth3 down
./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --bind=vfio-pci eth3
```

After every thing is finished, compile the application.
Make a "build" directory in ```/ports/unix/socketdpdk_server/``` with command:

```
cd ${path_to_socketdpdk_server}
mkdir build
```

Then build the application:

```
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

After that, use command to run:

```
./socket_server -c 2
```

Also, it takes the same procedures to compile and run the client in ```/ports/unix/socketdpdk_client/```.
Do not forget to change the ip/gateway/netmask to what you want in ```socket_server.c``` and ```socket_client.c```.
